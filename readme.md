<!-- GETTING STARTED
## How to test the program
<p>
Assume that you would like to travel, and you have been sent a test kit. 
You will not be allowed to travel unless your result is
negative. The test kit contains eight test strips.
The id's of your strips are: x000047, x000020 \n \
x000001, x000002, x000003, x000004, and x000005 from the data file.
You have done the test. Your strip now shows 
           
           
You can look at the data file to see which value represents \
            \n a negative result for each strip.")
    print("However, this would be hidden in real life.")
    answer = input("You can also use other strip id's from the data file \n")
